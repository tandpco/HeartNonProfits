    <section class="case-study">
        <p>I am the fourth generation in my family’s wholesale distribution business.  I decided to form a Board of Advisors for two main reasons: to provide a resource for my why (who is not active in the business) in the event of my death to incapacity and to provide outside perspective and experience in helping me make key strategic decisions.</p>
        <p>My Board consists of four people I have known and trusted for a long time: an attorney, a CPA (not the company’s CPA), a seasoned businessman and consultant, and an experienced former owner of a business in my industry.  The balance and camaraderie on the Board has been so good that I have not changed the composition in almost 20 years.
        The first issue where I needed the Board’s help was how to confront a non-performing key employee.  I was avoiding make the necessary decision and it was hurting the company.</p> <p>The Board’s advice was brutally correct.  They asked me, “Would you like you epitaph to read ‘He was good to his key employee, but he lost the company?’ ”  The Board helped me to prepare for the inevitable confrontation and to develop a fair severance package.</p>
        <p>The Board also played a critical role when the Company faced a financial crisis.  I had borrowed a considerable sum to build a plant.  Several unexpected setbacks put us out of covenant with our bank with potentially devastating consequences.  This was my first experience with the pitfalls of being overly leveraged, and I was in a panic.  My decision-making ability was clouded by my fear of failure.  Several members of my Board had gone through a similar challenge.  They helped me develop a recovery plan and make a confident presentation to my bank.   The bank agreed to a covenant waiver.  We were back in covenant within 6 months, after some significant cost cutting.</p>
        <p>Although I have always been a good strategist, idea person and leader, I am not always the best day-to-day manager.  My Board recognized this, but had a hard time convincing me to hire a COO to handle the daily management of the Company.  After a series of managing frustrations, I was finally ready.  With surprise, I selected one of my Board members (the industry insider).  We have been working together for 5 years now and it is one of the better management decisions I have made.</p>
        <p>The Board helped to give me clarity.</p>
