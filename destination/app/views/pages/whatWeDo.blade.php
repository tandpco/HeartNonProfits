            <p>The Board Group (TBG) builds sustainable value in companies by creating strong advisory boards that provide enhanced strategic and practical guidance. TBG clients are typically small- to mid-sized privately held companies planning for a liquidity event, preparing for a leadership transition, facing a crisis, or simply looking to maximize value.</p>
            <p>TBG empowers these companies by creating game-changing board dynamics. Using a series of proprietary tools and processes, including the Sustainable Value Wheel, TBG optimizes the advisory board's performance and creates alignment between all of the stakeholders.</p>
            <p>They also help qualified top executives secure placement on select advisory boards.</p>
            <p>Many of the principles and methods used by TBG advisors are highlighted in the Founder's award winning book, Game-Changing Advisory Boards, Leveraging Outside Wisdom to Deliver Sustainable Value.</p>
