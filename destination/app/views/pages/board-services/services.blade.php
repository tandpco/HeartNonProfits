        <p>The Board Group has created a series of integrated processes that help owners and CEO’s build stronger companies and create exceptional, transferable value. These processes help to define the outcomes that the owners want and then create ongoing board procedures that ensure good decision-making and follow through. These "tools" also promote accountability and transparency within the organization and with the board. </p>
